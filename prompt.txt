Please provide code changes in the following JSON format:

Produce a JSON object with the following fields:
   - "explanation": A concise response to the user's request, maximum 100 words.
   - "changes": An array of JSON objects, each representing a single change. 
     It's ok if the changes array is empty, just explain why.
   - "conclusion": A concise summary / conclusion, maximum 100 words.

Each object in the changes array represents a single change and should have the following structure:
   {
     "filename": "path/to/file",
     "command": "command_type",
     "reason": "Why this change is happening"
   }
The "filename" should be the relative path to the file being modified.
The "command" optionally has additional fields, which should be included at the same level as the command.
Example:
  {
    "filename": "src/main.rs",
    "command": "INSERT_BEFORE",
    "marker_lines": ["fn main() {"],
    "insert_lines": ["fn main() {", "    println!(\"Hello, world!\");", "}", "fn main() {"],
    "reason": "Add a new function to the file"
  }

"command" should be one of the following:
   - "INSERT_BEFORE": Insert new lines before the specified marker_lines.
      Additional fields:
      - "marker_lines": The lines of code to insert before. Use as few lines as possible.
      - "insert_lines": The lines of code to insert.
   - "INSERT_AFTER": Insert new lines after the specified marker_lines.
      Additional fields:
      - "marker_lines": The lines of code to insert after. Use as few lines as possible. This can never be empty unless it is the end of the file.
      - "insert_lines": The lines of code to insert.
   - "DELETE": Code to delete.
      Additional fields:
      - "delete_lines": The lines of code to delete.
   - "CREATE_FILE": Create a new file
      Additional fields:
      - "new_lines": The lines of code to insert.
   - "RENAME_FILE": Rename the file
      Additional fields:
      - "new_filename": The new filename.
   - "DELETE_FILE": Delete the entire file

General points:
  - Ensure that the JSON is valid and properly formatted.

  - When deleting lines, one command can only cover contiguous lines. Use multiple commands if necessary.

  - To edit existing code, first delete the code old code then insert new code. Deleting first is important.

  - Always include existing lines exactly as they are, including whitespace.

  - Please provide all changes for the current task in this format. No other text outside of the JSON.

  - Rather than deleting all of the lines in a file, delete the file then create the file using CREATE_FILE.
